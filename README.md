Just a guy who loves to code, occasionally cries over his own code… and then fixes it (probably while crying).

Trust me, I take clean code seriously.  
(Okay, maybe not *that* seriously.)

#### Fun Facts  
* Currently breaking and fixing things as a Backend Dev at a fintech.  
* Passionate about gaming, music, and art—basically everything that delays debugging.  
* I use Arch, btw.  
* And yes, I use NeoVim, btw. Because why not suffer in style?
